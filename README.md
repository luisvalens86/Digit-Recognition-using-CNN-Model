# Digit-Recognition-using-CNN-Model
Digit Recognition 

Abstract:
The goal of this presentation is to develop a model using neural network to recognize the hand-written digits for MNIST data set.

Goal is to achieve a high accuracy for predicting digits
We started with an 84% and was able to optimize our model to 99%

MNIST stands for the Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset that contains the images. The MNIST dataset is a collection of images representing the handwritten numerals 0 through 9.

Conclusion:
The result of our work shows that the maximum accuracy increased from 84.62% to 99.56% which was obtained in MNIST dataset using deep learning technique. 

It is observed that accuracy steadily remains constant after 10 epochs.

Test Accuracy is 99.56% and Validation Accuracy is 97.64%

Test accuracy also depends on learning rate of the model

Also, we can achieve more accuracy by increasing the batch size for training data and number of epochs.
